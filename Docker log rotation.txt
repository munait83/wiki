To enable docker log rotation to be the default on all created containers:
-Create /etc/docker/daemon.json and restart docker
vim /etc/docker/daemon.json


{
  "log-driver": "json-file",
  "log-opts": {
    "max-size": "10m",
    "max-file": "3" 
  }
}


#Restart Docker
systemctl restart docker
Notice that it won’t apply to existing containers. You may recreate them to have the setting applied or stop docker service and go to each container’s hostconfig.jason file and edit as follows:
Your container (abc) is located on /var/lib/docker/containers/abc/
vim /var/lib/docker/containers/abc/hostconfig.jason
In the file, look for:
{"Type":"json-file","Config":{}}
and change that to:
{"Type":"json-file","Config":{"max-file":"3","max-size":"10m"}}
then 
systemctl start docker
* Remember that docker must be stopped before the change, otherwise docker engine will revert the changes.
